# NewsGraphAggregator
The News Hunter platform harvests texts in real time from online news and social media. Each text is lifted semantically into a small knowledge graph that represents the text item (for example a tweet or an RSS article) itself along with the people, places, organisations etc it mentions. Sometimes these texts report the same events, which means that the smaller knowledge graphs that represent each of them should be merged into a larger event graph. The assignment is to develop a software tool that inputs a stream of small news graphs and identifies groups of graphs that may represent the same or closely related events, for example because they mention the same people, places or organisations around the same time. The tool shall then merge related graphs into larger single graphs that it outputs. We will give you access to a stream of news graphs you can use as input. It is a bonus if the tool offers a Fast API interface and runs in a Docker.
